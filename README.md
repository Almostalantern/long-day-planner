# long-day-planner

This is a day planner for normal 9-5 work hours. Past, present and future for the current day are all saved in your browser and are easily identifiable so you can access it as the day goes on. If you spend a lot of time at your computer, this project is a bare-bones way to try to keep track of any special events that may be on your schedule throughout your day.

# Motivation

This is yet another project in my attempt to understand Javascript and Jquery. This one has forced me to work with times and some conditions that I wasn't quite familiar with. I feel better about my command of javascript with this guy. It's still difficult for me, but it feels better to know that I could kind of make things work here. 

# Framework used

This guy is mostly HTML with a style file attached and a script file at the bottom of the HTML page.
